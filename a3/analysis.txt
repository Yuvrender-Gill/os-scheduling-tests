Most Frequently Accessed Pages:
  For instruction pages, 0x108000 is accessed the most.
  For data pages, 0x1fff000000 is accessed the most. 
Explanation: 
  For instruction pages, 0x108000 could be the page that cotains instructions like branch and arithmetic instructions like add,
  because the value of variale i needs to be incremented and checked for the loop condition at every iteration.
  For data pages, 0x1fff000000 could contain local varialbe i that needs to be accessed and updated at every iteration. 
  Note that the size of krec struct is 8 * 128 = 1024, so the assignment inside the while loop might not cause high access count for cerntain pages,
  since each page contains at most 4 krec structs.

Most Accessed Pages:
  For instruction pages, 0x108000 is accessed the most.
  For data pages, 0x1fff000000 is accessed the most. 
Explanation: 
  For instruction pages, 0x108000 could contain arithmetic instructions and branching instructions,
  because the value of local index variables like i, j, and k need to be recalculated and checked all the time. 
  For data pages, 0x1fff000000 could contain local variable like i, j and k that needs to be accessed, updated or reassigned at every iteration. 
  Note that repeated references of the actual matrices might not cause high page access count, since each matrix is rather big
  which means that each page can't fit too many matrices.

Most Frequently Accessed Pages:
    For instruction pages, 0x109000 is accessed the most.
    For data pages, 0x1fff000000 is accessed the most
Explanation: 
    For instructin pages, 0x109000 could contain arithmetic, branching, load and store instructions, 
    because the value of local index variables like i, j and k that need to be recalculated, reassigned and checked for loop conditions all the time. 
    For data pages, 0x1fff000000 could contain local variables like i, j and k that needs to be accessed, updated or reassigned at ever iteration. 
    Note that repeated refernces of the actual matrices might not cause high page access count, since a page does not contain too many matrices.
